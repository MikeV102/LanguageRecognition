MacIan," he said. "But we've been Legion men for five generations, and
I know the law; no man is to be questioned about his past. I'm going to
break the law. Why are you here, MacIan?"

MacIan's white head was gaunt and stubborn as Tantallon Rock, and he
kept silent.

"I'm trying to help," Lehn went on, "You've been an officer; every man
in the barracks knows that. If you're here for any reason but failure
in duty, you can be an officer again. I'll relieve you of special duty;
you can start working for the examinations. No need to waste you in the
ranks. Well?"

MacIan's eyes were hidden, but his voice was harsh. "What's behind
this, Lehn? What the hell is it to you?"

The Venusian's level gaze wavered; for a moment the boy looked through
the man, and MacIan felt a quick stab in his heart. Then all that was
gone, and Lehn said curtly.

"If you find the barracks congenial stay there, by all means.
Dismissed!"

MacIan glared at him half-blindly for a moment, his fine long hands
clenching and unclenching at his sides. Then he 'bout faced with
vicious smartness and went out.
