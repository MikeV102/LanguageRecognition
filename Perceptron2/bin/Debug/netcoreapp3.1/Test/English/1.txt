Silence was on the barracks like a lid clamped over tight-coiled
springs. Men in rumpled uniforms--outlanders of the Stellar Legion,
space-rats, the scrapings of the Solar System--sweated in the sullen
heat of the Venusian swamplands before the rains. Sweated and
listened.

The metal door clanged open to admit Lehn, the young Venusian
Commandant, and every man jerked tautly to his feet. Ian MacIan, the
white-haired, space-burned Earthman, alone and hungrily poised for
action; Thekla, the swart Martian low-canaler, grinning like a weasel
beside Bhak, the hulking strangler from Titan. Every quick nervous
glance was riveted on Lehn.

The young officer stood silent in the open door, tugging at his fair
mustache; to MacIan, watching, he was a trim, clean incongruity in this
brutal wilderness of savagery and iron men. Behind him, the eternal
mists writhed in a thin curtain over the swamp, stretching for miles
beyond the soggy earthworks; through it came the sound every ear had
listened to for days, a low, monotonous piping that seemed to ring
from the ends of the earth. The Nahali, the six-foot, scarlet-eyed
swamp-dwellers, whose touch was weapon enough, praying to their gods
for rain. When it came, the hot, torrential downpour of southern Venus,
the Nahali would burst in a scaly tide over the fort.

Only a moat of charged water and four electro-cannons stood between
the Legion and the horde. If those things failed, it meant two hundred
lives burned out, the circle of protective forts broken, the fertile
uplands plundered and laid waste. MacIan looked at Lehn's clean,
university-bred young face, and wondered cynically if he was strong
enough to do his job.
