Nearly an hour later he stood with the Martian Thekla on the
earthworks, waiting. The monotonous pipes prayed on in the swamp;
MacIan, looking up at the heavy sky, prayed just as hard that it would
not rain. Not just yet. Because if it rained before the patrol left,
the patrol would not leave; the Nahali would be on the march with the
very first drop.

"And my chance would be gone," he whispered to himself.

Thekla's bright black eyes studied him, as they always did; an
insolent, mocking scrutiny that angered the Scot.

"Well," he said dryly. "The perfect soldier, the gallant volunteer. For
love of Venus, Thekla, or love of the Legion?"

"Perhaps," said Thekla softly, "for the same reason you did, Earthman.
And perhaps not." His face, the swart, hard face of a low-canal outlaw,
was turned abruptly toward the mist-wrapped swamp. "Love of Venus!" he
snarled. "Who could love this lousy sweatbox? Not even Lehn, if he had
the brains of a flea!"

"Mars is better, eh?" MacIan had a sudden inspiration. "Cool dry air,
and little dark women, and the wine-shops on the Jekkara Low-canal.
You'd like to be back there, wouldn't you?"

To himself, he thought in savage pleasure, "I'll pay you out, you
little scum. You've tortured me with what I've lost, until I'd have
killed you if it hadn't been against my plan. All right, see if you can
take it!"
