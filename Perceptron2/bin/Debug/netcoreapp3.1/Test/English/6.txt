Bhak's fingers fell away abruptly. "They laugh at me," he repeated
miserably, "and run away. I know I'm ugly. But I want friends and a
wife, like anyone else. Especially a wife. But they laugh at me, the
women do, when I ask them. And...." He was shaking suddenly with rage
and his face was a beast's face, blind and brutal. "And I kill them. I
kill the damned little vixens that laugh at me!"

He stared stupidly at his great hands. "Then I have to run away. Always
running away, alone." The bright, empty eyes met MacIan's with deadly
purpose. "That's why I want the money. If I have money, they'll like
me. Women always like men who have money. If I kill one of you, I'll
have to run away again. But if I have someone to go with me. I won't
mind."

Thekla showed his pointed teeth. "Try strangling a Nahali girl, Bhak.
Then we'll be rid of you."

Bhak grunted. "I'm not a fool. I know what the Nahali do to you. But I
want that money the girl told about, and I'll get it. I'd get it now,
only Lehn will come."

He stood over them, grinning. MacIan drew back, between pity and
disgust. "The Legion is certainly the System's garbage dump," he
muttered in Martian, loud enough for Thekla to hear, and smiled at the
low-canaler's stifled taunt. Stifled, because Lehn was coming up, his
heavy water-boots thudding on the soggy ground.
