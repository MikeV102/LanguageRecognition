The slow dusk was falling; Thekla's dark face was a blur but MacIan
knew he had got home. "The fountains in the palace gardens, Thekla;
the sun bursting up over red deserts; the singing girls and the _thil_
in Madame Kan's. Remember the _thil_, Thekla? Ice cold and greenish,
bubbling in blue glasses?"

He knew why Thekla snarled and sprang at him, and it wasn't Thekla he
threw down on the soft earth so much as a tall youngster with a fair
mustache, who had goaded with good intent. Funny, thought MacIan, that
well-intentioned goads hurt worse than the other kind.

A vast paw closed on his shoulder, hauling him back. Another, he saw,
yanked Thekla upright. And Bhak the Titan's hairy travesty of a face
peered down at them.

"Listen," he grunted, in his oddly articulated Esperanto. "I know
what's up. I got ears, and village houses got thin walls. I heard the
Nahali girl talking. I don't know which one of you has the treasure,
but I want it. If I don't get it...."

His fingers slid higher on MacIan's shoulder, gripped his throat. Six
fingers, like iron clamps. MacIan heard Thekla choking and cursing; he
managed to gasp:

"You're in the wrong place, Bhak. We're men. I though you only
strangled women."

The grip slackened a trifle. "Men too," said Bhak slowly. "That's why
I had to run away from Titan. That's why I've had to run away from
everywhere. Men or women--anyone who laughs at me."

MacIan looked at the blank-eyed, revolting face, and wondered that
anyone could laugh at it. Pity it, shut it harmlessly away, but not
laugh.
