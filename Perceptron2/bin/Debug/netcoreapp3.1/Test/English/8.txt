Big drops, splattering slowly down, making a sibilant whisper across
the swamp. The pipes broke off, leaving the ears a little deafened with
the lack of them after so long. And MacIan, looking at Lehn, swore
furiously in his heart.

The three men paused, expecting an order to turn back, but Lehn waved
them on.

"But it's raining," protested Bhak. "Well get caught in the attack."

The officer's strangely hard face was turned toward them. "No," he
said, with an odd finality, "they won't attack. Not yet."

They went on, toward the swamp that was worse in silence than it had
been with the praying pipes. And MacIan, looking ahead at the oddly
assorted men plowing grimly through the mud, caught a sudden glimpse of
something dark and hidden, something beyond the simple threat of death
that hung always over a reconnoitering patrol.

       *       *       *       *       *

The swamp folded them in. It is never truly dark on Venus, owing to the
thick, diffusing atmosphere. There was enough light to show branching,
muddy trails, great still pools choked with weeds, the spreading
_liha_-trees with their huge pollen pods, everything dripping with the
slow rain. MacIan could hear the thudding of that rain for miles around
on the silent air; the sullen forerunner of the deluge.

Fort and village were lost in sodden twilight. Lehn's boots squelched
onward through the mud of a trail that rose gradually to a ridge of
higher ground. When he reached the top, Lehn turned abruptly, his
electro-gun seeming to materialize in his hand, and MacIan was startled
by the bleak look of his pink, young face.

"Stop right there," said Lehn quietly. "Keep your hands up. And don't
speak until I'm finished."
